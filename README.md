# Sparse Bayesian Learning: A Diversified Scheme
This set of Matlab (Vision R2021b) functions contain the core code to reproduce the results of the above paper.

* DivSBL.m  ---> the main function for Diversified Block Sparse Bayesian Learning.

**For convenience, ```'DivSBL.m' is directly provided in each demo folders.``` **

    # Please note that the value of the `PRUNE_GAMMA` parameter in 'DivSBL.m' function needs to be manually adjusted according to the data.

    # We have already set appropriate sizes for the data style in the demo. If you need to change the data, you may need to adjust its values accordingly.


## Set path

-- The following 5 sub-files in DivSBL_public folder need to be manually read by the user into the MATLAB path, for use in comparative experiments in the demo folders. 

    * BCS_fast_rvm.m        ---> The function file for SBL(RVM) algorithm from [1],

    * CVX                   ---> Matlab software for disciplined convex programming from [2],

    * PCSBL.m               ---> The function file for PC-SBL algorithm from [3],

    * spgl1-2.1             ---> A solver for large-scale sparse reconstruction from [4],

    * StructOMP Released 2  ---> The function file for StructOMP algorithm from [5].




## Folder 1: demo_Synthetic signal 

    * DEMO_Synthetic_Signal.m   ---> generate a compressed sensing demo for synthetic signal using 7 different algorithms.

    (Some audio in WAV format for testing purposes are also provided here.ï¼‰
  
  
  
## Folder 3: demo_Image

    * DEMO_image_public_parrots.m   ---> generate a compressed sensing demo for Parrot image.
    * DWTM.mat                      ---> A decrete wavelet transform matrix provided by [3].
